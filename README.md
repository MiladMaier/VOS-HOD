We express our gratitude to Xuefeng Du, Zhaoning Wang, Mu Cai and Yixuan Li for creating Virtual Outlier Synthesis. Original repository of VOS: https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/vos.
Our repository extends VOS with higher-order discrimination (VOS-HOD) to increase out-of-distribution detection performance in object detection.
